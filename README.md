# Using Large Language Models for the the Identification of Relevant Analysis Data and Report Templates: A Prototypical Evaluation based on GPT-models

This is the repository for my bachelor thesis. It contains the code for an MVP which uses a RAG-Architecture to embedd existing SAP Databases and SQL code in a ChromaDB vector database to retrieve relevant Analysis Data based on natural language queries from business users. Unfortunately the prototype can not be rerun locally, because the used data was provided from a company and therefore has to remain private.
